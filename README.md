The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted people's lives globally, 
and social media platforms like Twitter have become a platform for sharing experiences and emotions. 
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of public opinion on COVID-19 by developing a sentiment analysis model for a dataset of COVID-19 related tweets. 
The model will classify each tweet into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. 
This analysis will provide insights into public perception of the pandemic, including anxieties, concerns, and potential areas of gratitude or hope expressed on social media.
